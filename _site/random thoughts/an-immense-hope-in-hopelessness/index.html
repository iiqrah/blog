          <p>I feel extremely hopeless so I need to vent out my thoughts and come to terms with it.</p>

<p>Hi there, no one.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time since I wrote.</p>

<p>Wrong priorities like university took over.</p>

<p>Before starting this post, I had a read on the other three that I published and I have come to the realization that I have shared an uncomfortable amount of my personal life. I could have just made an anonymous account, but we are too deep into this already, besides why should only Facebook have the right to get a sneak peek into my personal life.</p>

<p>I am fully aware of how messy my digital footprint is at the moment, but I cannot even get myself to untangle my earphone wires, let alone cleanse my digital data. We are all going to die soon anyway. None of this would matter then.</p>

<p>So I wanted to write this post ranting and venting out my current feelings about university and the education system as a whole.</p>

<p>For a few days now, I was finding it really hard to understand why I am enrolled at a university and willingly wasting time not doing anything constructive.</p>

<p>It took a bit of pondering to realize that the reason I joined uni in the first place was purely because of my interest in the subject that I developed in high school. I wanted to explore this field further, not realizing uni life is all about finding a high paying job offer and getting good grades in your exams.</p>

<p>Since I joined uni, I haven’t experienced the kind of mental growth I was hoping for. A lot of the content is not presented in a way that allows me to quench my thirst for exploration.</p>

<p>It was becoming a little frustrating to know that I allowed my younger, dumber, naive Iqrah to decide the course my future will be taking. But then again, considering I haven’t really grown that much, I am still quite similar to that Iqrah, so I hold no grudges against her. She took the best decision she could, considering the situation and limited knowledge she had (and has).</p>

<p>I do not want to sound completely ungrateful, a lot of good things have come from being at uni. But pure academic-wise, I haven’t found it challenging enough. It is annoying to be spoon-fed chunks of new coding paradigm.</p>

<p>But then again, I do not think I am smart enough to figure out these paradigms on my own, but ain’t that the reason why I enrolled myself at university? To be taught in an understanding manner.</p>

<p>I wasn’t aware that I will be spending a huge amount of money merely to get a piece of paper that supposedly declares me qualified to attain the knowledge in a subject I decided to pursue, even though deep down I know, the information disappeared from my brain the moment I closed my pen cap or switched of my pc I was attempting my exam on.
So yeah, all this was making me feel quite helpless. The next logical thought was to end this “misery” (being a little bit too dramatic here) and not waste any more time and cash on this pointless endeavour, aka drop out.</p>

<p>But additional to being not too smart or knowledgeable, I am also very gutless. And dropping out from something right away takes a lot of courage which I am deprived of currently. Drastic change requires guts, and I am too comfortable in my student accommodation sofa right now to give up this comforting and known environment. I would rather just rant about it in a post than take actions.</p>

<p>But this realization and this feeling of hopelessness did make me reach out to people and ask them about their aspirations and dreams, their reasoning of why they are doing what they are doing, why they want to do what they want to do.</p>

<p>Side note: these conversations were quite intriguing and have sparked a new curiosity in me to find out more about the reasoning behind decisions people make. It is being a bit too nosey, but some humans love sharing their personal lives without having a care in the world, often times to another human being and the other times online, maybe on a medium post.</p>

<p>Even after having these conversations, I still felt quite hopeless about myself.
Whenever I have found myself in a hopeless situation, I write my thoughts out.
So that is what I did, last night.</p>

<p>Not here, but in my physical personal diary. And while I was ranting away my frustration and hopelessness, I came to a marvellous realization, which is what I wanted to capture in this post because, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+translate+%D9%84%D8%A7+%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%AD+%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87&amp;oq=google+translate+%D9%84%D8%A7+%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%AD+%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64j69i60l3.422j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">la samah allah</a>, my diary drowns before my life comes to an end, I will still be able to access my forgotten thoughts here.</p>

<p>So what I realized is:</p>

<p>If I do drop out, then what?</p>

<p>If I haven’t figured out the latter, then why drop out?</p>

<p>If I do figure out what I want to do with my life, why not just do it?</p>

<p>Unless staying at uni would hinder my aspirations, I could just get on with making my life useful without necessarily having to drop out.</p>

<p>This made total sense to me. And made me realize that the flawed educational system is not entirely to be blamed for my hopelessness. I am equally to be blamed too.</p>

<p>If I want to explore more about the subject that I am interested in, no one is stopping me from doing it except for myself.</p>

<p>If I want to make a difference in this world, even though I have no idea how to, no one is stopping me from figuring out how except for myself.</p>

<p>Turns out Shia LaBeouf did know what he was talking about. There was more to it than just meme-ing it in inappropriate contexts. For the first time ever, watching that video gave me goosebumps, along with the prevalent laughter because it is still way too much emotion for me to take it seriously.</p>

<p>So I would like to believe that this realization brings a lot more hope in my hopelessness. The awareness also brings along a lot more responsibility as I can no longer blame anyone else other than myself for not doing what I want to do or at least trying to figure out what I want to do and then trying to do it.</p>

<p>I’ll keep you posted about how I failed (or did not fail) at turning things around.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, I drown to death before I get to write my update.</p>
