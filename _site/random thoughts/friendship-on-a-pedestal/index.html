          <p>A recent crush on a school friend made me write this post.</p>

<p>Don’t think you happen to notice but it’s been a long time since I published a story.
No real reason other than my mind being very scattered which has resulted in many half finished story drafts that I predict will remain unfinished for a long time because I have outgrown my trail of thought about them.</p>

<p>Anywho, today I want to write out my perspective on friendship.
Why friendship in particular you may ask, or rather I force you to ask?
Because only yesterday I came to the realisation that I have no friends, or rather feel like I have no friends.</p>

<p>On a completely unrelated note, I used to confuse the spelling of friends, did not know if the i or the e came first, the song Friends by Anne-Marie and Marshmello has really helped with that. If you know, you know, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8E6N5Nzec">else find out</a>.</p>

<p>It is not that I just happen to have a voilà moment yesterday, where I went “Voilà! I think I have no friends.”</p>

<p>The feeling has always existed but only yesterday while speaking to a school friend about my long obnoxious history of having too many short-lived crushes and trying to find the reason for it is when I realised it could be because I don’t have a tight group of friends, especially after high-school here in a new country that I moved to for university.</p>

<p>He said that he has noticed, that unlike others, I don’t seem to have a group of friends that I hang out with. And this may not be a bad thing but it could be the reason why whenever I get comfortable enough to talk to someone new, I develop a short-lived crush on them.</p>

<p>I think regardless of whether I would like to have a group of friends to hang out with or not, this particular observation does make sense and could be very well the reason why I have far few friends and much many crushes.</p>

<p>I am aware that all this could be complete bogus, but at the very least it was a catalyst to help me introspect more about the way I look at friendship and ponder as to why I skip straight to crushes rather than just have those new people become my friends instead.</p>

<p>Since moving here, it’s been over 3 years now, I have met and interacted with a lot of people. There are way too many pre-strangers that are now active acquaintances or some-bodies that I used to know, but it is borderline discomforting for me to refer to, most if not, all of them to be my friends.</p>

<p>A part of me thinks that if I were to have not know of the existence of the word acquaintance, I could potentially have way more friends without changing a single thing in my life at this given moment, but maybe not. Let me delve upon that some other day, it is not like I would ever know for sure because that’s just how things are with most “what if” scenarios.</p>

<p>In the past, I have asked people how they come to the realisation that a certain someone is their friend. I have gotten varied answers and sometimes weird concerning looks because of it.</p>

<p>Some don’t put any thought into it at all, “it just happens naturally”. For some, just knowing a bit more about someone, other than their name, is enough to call them their friend and there are some that have people that they grew up with or happen to share loads with which has made them feel comfortable enough to call those people their friend. Oh, and there are some people that think they have no friends.
Now this was really interesting to me because it made me realise that often times than not I tend to meet a new person, talk to them and if we “click”, I rather have them assigned the label of an acquaintance or a crush, depending on certain other characteristics, than simply just a friend which is ridiculous but that is just what I tend to do.</p>

<p>I am not sure why but I have a very high regard when it comes to friendship, almost as if I put <em>friendship on a pedestal</em>.</p>

<p>One of the possibilities could be that I consider a friend to be someone that I can be truly vulnerable in front of, someone I can completely trust and hope to never hurt or get hurt by. It is a pretty big ask which I don’t expect most people to fulfil. By categorising them as acquaintance, they don’t have to abide by any of my high standards and by being a crush it is more of a one-sided relationship at least from my eyes so that gives me the option to get hurt by them through future interactions and not feel bad about it?</p>

<p>I don’t know if any of this makes any sense. I don’t think any of this is worth even reading. I feel a strong urge to apologise to you if you happened to reach till this point. I’m sorry.</p>

<p>This seems like an unfinished story to me because I do not want to introduce a turning point and be like “Voilà! I think I am going to have friends.” because whatever I have shared right now about my perspective on friendship is something I standby. It is just that I wasn’t as hyper aware about it until I tried analysing my reasons for having so many crushes.</p>

<p>I am also aware that I am considered to be a friend by more people than the number of people I consider my friend. I am also open to the idea that there are and would be people that I consider friends who might not consider me their friend.
No one passed on the guide to me about friendship so not really sure about the rights and wrongs or the do’s and don’ts.</p>

<p>Maybe in a few year’s time or sooner all this wouldn’t make any sense to me either. But I am not too bothered by that because I am sure to outgrow my current outlook of the world, or rather to hope to outgrow my current outlook of the world, I have to experience more of life, friendship and perception.</p>
