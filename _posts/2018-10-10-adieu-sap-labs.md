September 7, 2018 was my last working day of my 3.9 year stint with SAP Labs India, Bangalore.

I joined as a Developer Associate @ SAP Cloud Platform, contributing to the Job Scheduler as a Service on Cloud Foundry. It was amazing journey since January 2015 that enriched my knowledge and experience developing highly scalable services for a Platform.

Bidding adieu is painful, especially to a few people who supported and guided me through my career in SAP. It was indeed a privilege working with these folks!
