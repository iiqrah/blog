This is me trying to write my first online, public facing write-up for the world to see.

This feels so weird.

I have never really dared to experiment with this realm of writing and posting my thoughts online for anyone to take a sneak peek at.

It is not that I am not comfortable with this, but I definitely feel weird.
Weird: a word in the English language that helps me describe a feeling whenever I lack the knowledge of a better word to describe the feeling.

On a second thought, let me actually Google the word to find the official meaning of it. [Meaning of weird](https://www.google.com/search?q=weird+meaning&oq=weird+meaning&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l6j69i60.2042j1j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).That is extremely intriguing to me, at least the Scottish and archaic meaning: "a person's destiny". Never really thought it had any connection with destiny or fate.

But oh well, here I am typing away my abrupt and unplanned thoughts at 10:41 pm (Qatar time, (ooops is that too much personal information to give out about myself? The advertisers probably already know that and have probably shoved me into a target audience that resides in Qatar, so I guess it does not matter.)) in my room, without having any intention of doing so, so in a way feeling weird does seem appropriate.

I have completely lost track of why I even began to write, and this post just seems like it's turning into a post about weird, which is why I am going to start bold-ing (is that even a word? at least for now it is) the word weird so that I can count how many times I used it in this post.

Right, so going back to a previous thought about how anyone would be able to get a sneak peak of my brain dump, I think that's the top-most contributing factor to why I feel weird. But then again, I highly doubt anyone would search for the title that I have given this post, and having no followers would help, if not no one else, then at least very limited amount of people to discover this.

Don't get me wrong, I am aware of other services where you are able to write without having to post it publicly, but that seems similar to writing in my diary, that I have done for a very long time since I acquired the skill to form thoughts and sentences.
I obviously wasn't consistent enough to write every single day of my life but often enough to have captured all kinds of emotions and note-worthy memories, not all the note-worthy memories, but enough to make me nostalgic and proud to have been able to capture them.

So yeah, I wanted to try something new for a change, and this seems exciting, weird but exciting, so I shall give this a try.

I think I am done for today, the green Publish button in this all B&W themed interface is calling for me. Love the aesthetics of this GUI btw, after-all B&W is my all time favourite colour combination. Ah, great! Let the B&W coloured product advertisements commence.
