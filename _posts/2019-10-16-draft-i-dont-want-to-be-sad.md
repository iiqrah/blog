Unfinished write-up of when I was feeling pretty sad.

Hi, if you are reading this and for some reason you know me in real life, you will disregard this at first glance.

I do not appear to be sad to anyone that has met me a few times. I do my best to hide my feelings, and I am aware that I am not the discoverer of being able to do that. I have never understood why I do it, all I know is, I just do it, naturally, with minimal effort. 

It takes a lot more effort to put down my facade and unleash the shit-storm that is bottled up than just pretend to be happy. But it is not that simple, especially on occasions where I am able to fool myself too about being happy, because in those occasions am I genuinely happy or am I putting a facade of being happy to myself? Have I really mastered the art that well that I can fool myself? 

But I was reading a book about emotions once. The book was divided into 9 chapters, each talking about a particular emotion: happiness, sadness, disgust, anger, jealousy, hate, love, sympathy and guilt. Not sure about the order, all I remember was I only read the first two chapters which was about happiness and sadness. I don't claim to have a good memory but in one of the pages it mentioned how to feel one emotion, you have to feel the opposite emotion first, so to feel sadness, a person would have to feel happy at some point, and considering that is true, I would like to believe I have felt happiness, because I know for a fact that I feel sad. 

I haven't given much thought into if that is entirely true
