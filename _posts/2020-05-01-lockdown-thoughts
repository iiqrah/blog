If you cannot tell already, the title is a play on the words, and not in avery good way if I say so myself.


We are in the middle of a pandemic so yep, we are in lockdown, but that's become the perfect breeding ground for lockdown thoughts to surface again, so I shall also take this opportunity to share my thoughts on lockdown as a whole too.


Be in about the regular uncertainty of finding my purpose in life, pinpointing all my minute and major flaws in glory to thinking about exes that don’t deserve a milliampere of my brainpower. This lockdown has got it all covered.


It’s not that these thoughts have never surfaced before but I always had a way to be distracted by other things happening in my life, now it’s a discussion for another day whether simply just distracting myself rather than taking the time to untangle my thoughts is the right way to go about it or not, besides I’d rather just have that discussion with a qualified therapist, once I can afford one but some thoughts cannot end with proper closure and that’s all the closure ai can get from those types.


While showering today I had a thought that maybe we humans are defaulting into drowning away in our thoughts during this lockdown is perhaps due to evolution?


The human brain has evolved into this power-hungry machine in our body, and now that we don’t really have much work to do, it still needs to work in some way, so maybe it is resorting to accessing and working with old locked-away files and memories?


Oops, I need to attend a call with a technician to fix my laptop right now.


I guess this will be another unfinished post. Sorry, not sorry.
