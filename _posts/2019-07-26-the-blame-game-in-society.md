The situation with GitHub and US sanction trade laws made me feel the need to write this post.

I am deeply saddened and disgusted by what I came across my newsfeed right now about Iranians and citizens of a few other countries losing access to their GitHub benefits because of some US sanction trade laws.

I get the frustration of millions of developers and GitHub users, their instinct to blame the company and the CEO. They are doing what any emotional human being would do, try to find an entity to blame for their suffering, even though GitHub is merely following laws issued by the US government. I have done a really dangerous thing here. By making that statement alone, I have contributed to this blind mindless blame game of pointing fingers at the government instead of the company, which probably roots from my personal preferential biases for GitHub and my ignorant uninformed understanding of the government.

It is extremely easy for me to cater to my biases and shift the blame on the ruthless decisions of the government, but I truly took no effort into understanding the reasoning behind these laws. And to be completely honest, I do not even think I will, probably because I do not care enough? And it is much easier to just find an entity you dislike, connect it to the problem and blame it.

Often times I let me thinker personality run wild. I am left pondering as to how we have let the society embody the principles that it has today, and if it would be different in case another set of humans would be responsible for building the early stages, but that is as pointless as thinking what if **insert literally anything**, and for all I know, it could turn out to be worse than what it is right now. What ifs are a pointless time-wasting thought process to be in unless they are directed towards something that can actually be changed and have a purpose, for the good or bad, behind it.

All I know, and I am completely aware that I could be wrong, but all I know is I can not help in any way or make a difference, at least not a substantial one. So all I choose to do is briefly get affected by it, rant about it through my cluttered and disorganized writing and then go on living my unaffected life. It is such a privileged curse to feel so helpless about making this world a better place because I lack the first-hand suffering of these atrocities that happen in our society, which lets my self-loathing narcissistic self think that, perhaps, I could be the one to be blamed for all of the sufferings in the world.
