I am in a really dark place and I need to vent out my emotions, it is too much to handle.

Hi there, Iqrah.

I am writing this, so obviously I did not follow through. Unless I stop midway of writing this and just go ahead and do the deed.

But I know I won't. I really don't have the guts to.

It is weird because I have never felt this way before.

I don't even know why I woke up today with such a strong urge to want to kill myself, even though I know I won't.

So obviously, the next logical thing I did was google "suicide". A helpline for [Samaritans](https://www.google.com/search?q=suicide&oq=suicide&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j46l2j0l2j69i60l3.1221j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) came up. But I am really not the kind of person that likes phone calls, that would lead to more stress and anxiety, so it is kind of ironic how that was the first thing that was recommended.

Especially because my online presence is being tracked so efficiently, the least they can do is provide me with a customized suicide prevention strategy.

Never have I ever received an ad for Always Sanitary napkins, but on the day of my period, voila! the first ad I see on YouTube is an Always Sanitary pad ad.

So then I clicked on the NHS resource, 90% of it was advising me to just talk to someone, the same advice written in 10 different ways.

But I did not know what to talk to or who to talk to.

I am really good at unloading irrelevant baggage on some of my friends but when it comes to things like killing myself, I really don't want them to get worried unnecessarily, especially because I don't have it in me to follow through, so it is kind of a wasted effort on their side to be all emotional and convince me about how much I mean to them etc etc.

But I did choose a random friend and decided to try and talk about it, but his advice was to "talk to a professional", "get professional help" etc.

And he was talking from "personal experience".

So in my head, I was just like "Wow wtf, is this some sort of hierarchal procedure of referring to one person/institution after the other and get to talk to as many people as you possibly can" but talking is not my strongest suit so I am doomed before I can even begin to unravel this for myself? Guess that leaves me with the only option that is killing myself? Which again I won't do, so am I just supposed to sit here in my flat, balling my eyes out due to my incapability of seeking help or going through with the plan? What a great first world problem to have.

I tried to search suicide + my university's name, and the article that showed up was about this guy who I was in foundational year with, and the title said "Student who self-harmed was given 10 minutes with university counsellor before taking his life a day later", so talking does not really work always, does it?

I also felt a strong urge to tell my parents that I miss them. I HAVE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE. But it was nice to let them know that I actually do love and miss them.
My next Google search was trying to find live footage of suicide attempts, just trying to figure out how do people do it and how long it takes. If I would have dug deeper I guess I would find more options. But all I could find were gunshots, and I don't possess a gun so I cannot really use that methodology.

But it was amusing to see how fast everything ends. Or at least it appears to. No one other than that person can tell you if it actually is as painless as it appears to be.
But after dwelling for quite some time on this topic, I was calmer.

In the span of my research, I was also chatting with a few other people about different things. One friend was trying to explain how weird he felt waking up from a vivid dream, I was also trying to help another friend with her love life.

No idea how but this vivid dream conversation segued into me light-heartedly talking about my research and what I was feeling. He thought I was joking at first, but even when he realized I wasn't, he kept the banter going which was kind of nice.

I like joking about death, even when my life or my loved one's life is at stake.

But yeah, the conversation was really helpful.

Conveniently enough, my mom also saw the message around the same time, which led her to get worried. Stupid me. So she called.

We talked. At first, she thought it had something to do with guys and relationship problems, but talking to her made me realize it was just my stress related to the hackathon that I am organizing. The planning has been going on for the last six months, and it has emotionally and physically drained me.

It seems quite trivial but I feel this immense pressure of disappointing everyone involved, or things not going according to plan, two weeks left and things are already falling apart, so idk, it felt easier to run away from this commitment and end this constant stress. I could not even do my programming assignment to my fullest capability because of this hackathon.

But I really cannot end my life. I want to do so much good in this world, make a difference, so I really don't think that the world would be a better place without me sticking around until I am "destined" to.

I do not really have an exceptional artistic talent that can sway the world like Freddie Mercury did, but at least I would like to make an effort into making this world a better place.

So my mom advised me to get out of my bed, take a bath and deal with one issue at a time, related to this hackathon. And that is what I tried doing.

Replied to a bunch of e-mails. Made a few phone calls. None made any real progress because e-mails are such an inefficient way of communication and financial transactions take so long, and to make matters worse, you have zero to no control over both of them so you're just left hanging helplessly.

But bathing really helped. Idk why but it did.

Late evening I caught up with another friend that I had sort of distanced myself from for a long time. It was hard not crying in front of him, stupid me. But it was cool.
Rest of the day I was just conversing with that vivid dreamer friend. He suggested I watch my first twitch stream: Asmongold Welfare Wednesday.

Some of the troll videos that he was paid to watch were genuinely hilarious.
But midway I just dozed off and had the best peaceful sleep in a really long time. But my sleep schedule is totally messed up now. I have also made the wrong decision of drinking coffee, so I am wide awake.

At the back of my mind, I am still thinking about loads of things that need to be done for the hackathon. And I only have 10 days left to complete it all.
But I am going to quote my friend here to remind me "a hackathon is not worth a life especially one that has a good future".

I think my last search of the day is "does it hurt to cut your wrist", some really insightful answers on Quora. Getting really tired of this samaritan helpline that I am being suggested in all suicide-related searches.

Honestly though, I would rather kill myself than engage in a phone call.

But re-reading whatever I wrote till now is making me realize how talking did help. I did not intend to talk but somehow organically it happened.

Hypocrisy at it's finest. Makes me a self-aware hypocrite which in my opinion is worse.
But that's all from me for now.

Hopefully, if I am alive after the 27th, I'll update about how the hackathon actually went, or if it even happened or not.

Adios.
