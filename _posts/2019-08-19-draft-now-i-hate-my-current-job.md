Unfinished write-up of my emotions towards my job. I have since resigned and feel way more at peace.

Is there literally anything in this world that I will do which I would not hate or rant about at first? 

Before starting this post, I re-read all my previous stories. It was a nice trip down memory lane, and it was surprising to see I still stand by all my opinions still that were written months ago. The writing itself is not too great and confusing at times, but oh well, I never claimed to be a proficient writer. And I extremely glad that I did not let me mediocre writing skills stop me from capturing my thoughts at my most vulnerable times. 

After reading all the stories, I resonate the most with the one titled "Immense hope in hopelessness", except for the title itself, because I find myself to be in an extremely hopeless situation and cannot seem to find any hope let alone immense hope. 

It is Day 36/365 of my first job, and I cannot seem to settle in. I have definitely gotten better at being desensitised to my emotional state and self-worth at work, and not get TOO worked up about how I feel like I am wasting my life away in front of a computer for the majority of the week without doing anything that could add value to this world or my personal growth. First few days were the absolute worst, enough to make me profusely cry at the thought of coming to work, I could not even get myself to write a post to explain my state of mind.
