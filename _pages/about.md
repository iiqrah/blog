My name is **Jain Basil Aliyas**, and this is my blog where I occassionally share my thoughts, experiences and some tutorials (which I think would help my readers). I am a software developer by profession, working primarily on the edtech industry. Ruby on Rails, Python 3 and Golang are the part of my toolbox and I love building scalable, performat systems on cloud.

I am passionate about Opensource and have contributed to a couple of projects like Scribus, KDE etc. through Google Summer of Code (2010 and 2011 editions).
